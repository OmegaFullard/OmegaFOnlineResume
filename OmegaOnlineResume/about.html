       This website was designed in order to practice web design. I currently work for the City of Philadelphia as a Programmer Analyst. I am studying to become a full stack developer. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also learning how to use GitHub. I am excited to learn more about web development.
